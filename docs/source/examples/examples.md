```{admonition} About these notebooks
:class: tip

The links below will lead you to html versions of jupyter notebooks with code examples. They are not fully interactive; for example, you will not be able to see figures updating when you toggle sliders, etc.

You can find the notebook files (`.ipynb`) on the [kval Github page](https://github.com/NPIOcean/kval/tree/master/docs/source/examples/notebooks)
