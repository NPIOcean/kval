# TO DO

### Generally abount oceanograPy

- Define some *code guidelines*! 
- Define *contributor guidelines:* e.g.maybe Ã˜L should review PRs for this one..
- Think about *tests*!
- Move things over from the old `oyv` module - but be a little discriminatory, want to reserve this for relatively useful stuff and relatively clean code.
- Thinking of building the ctd-processing toolbox in here - but maybe it should be separate, actually? Don't want to put *everything* in opy..
- Make pip installable (so we can cspecify pip install from git in a conda environment..).
