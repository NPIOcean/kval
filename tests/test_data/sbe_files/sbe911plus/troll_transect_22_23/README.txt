Note:

A small subset of CTD data from the Troll Transect cruise.

The cnvs are *non-binned* data, which it is useful to include in the test suite. However, 
this makes the full files much larger (>15MB) than I am happy to keep in the repo.

Therefore cut away most of the profiles to get each files down to about 1MB (still not ideal,
but good enoug for now). Cut away most of the surface soak and then everything after hitting about 100 dbar.
